	<p><i>The cub's continued enthusiasm was remarkable.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Mommy!&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>A gentle, blue-white glow shot in front of me and into the ceiling.
    Lungs burning - I wasted no time in following him.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <p><i>I wished I had...</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;Mom...my?&quot; The cub was tentative - pausing almost
    dramatically as a sense of dread began permeating the waters around me.
    &quot;What's wrong with Daddy?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>It was then I noticed. Drifting lifelessly in cloud of red was
    &quot;Daddy&quot; - a mountain of a man. Just over 8 feet in height his
    gargantuan frame floated - pierced from all angles with a dozen spears.
    Badly shredded clothing adorned his muscular, ebony form - his skin covered
    with marks made from bite upon bite dealt by the rodents whose lifeless
    bodies now floated - carpeting the ceiling. His forehead was caved in from a
    blow. Bruises and cuts marred his face - an expression of mixed anger and
    sorrow still apparent beneath.</i></p>
    <p><i>And that's when I felt his disembodied hand brush against my side.</i></p>
    <p><i>I screamed.</i></p>
    <p><i><b>PANIC! </b>Eyes wide I searched desperately for reprieve. I'd just
    expelled the last of my air - good or not. The next breath would be my last.
    For no other reason than my own determination did I survive - my now fevered
    mind begging the cub for his help.</i></p>
    <p><i>As I'd hoped - he heard me. He flashed a pleading expression to his
    mother - who's face remained warm, and gentle. She smiled.</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;Breathe, child.&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>Her voice was soft and caring. It was strong, and warm. I wanted more
    than anything to trust her - but I couldn't. I pressed against the floor of
    the chamber - mistakenly launching myself into the ceiling - headlong. The
    pain was intense - small amounts of my own blood now mingling with that of
    the Father's as I clutched at the new wound. Everything faded to darkness.</i></p>
    <p><i>And then my eyes opened.</i></p>
    <p><i>There was a flash - myself momentarily enveloped in the same,
    bluish-white glow of the cub. Then water... I felt water - cooling my lungs
    as it rushed in.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;I'm drowning!&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>There was nothing more I could do. Passing out - even for a second -
    was all my body needed to regain control over my breathing. The water was
    rushing in. I was out of air. I was dying. There was nothing more I could
    do. I gave up.</i></p>
    <p><i>Then my body went limp - and I coughed.&nbsp;</i></p>
    <p><i>The offending fluid expelled partially from my lungs it rushed back in
    - beginning to flow in and out of my lungs as I coughed violently. Gathering
    myself mentally, I took a final deep breath and was finally calm. And
    breathing.</i></p>
    <p><i>And amazed to be alive.</i></p>
    <p><i>Oko grinned broadly. &quot;Terra!&quot; he screamed - jetting through
    the water on powerful forepaws. With an excited cry the cub struck my belly
    in a mock-hug. His enthusiasm was like a kid's at Christmas - each call of
    my name even more enthusiastic than the last. &quot;Terra! Terra! Terra!
    Terra! Terra! Thank you, Mommy!&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>I looked to Mommy - who simply smiled. It was as if I felt a tear in
    her eye - sadness weighing her heart. It was then that she spoke again -
    saddened and uncertain.</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;The time has come where we must pass - and our burden must pass
    to you. Your inheritance ... is this.&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>From the floor in front of me lifted a book - unaffected by the waters
    around it. &quot;Take it.&quot; she continued. Reaching out, I took the book
    - placing it into a leather pack the cub brought me in his teeth. &quot;It
    was Daddy's.&quot; he whispered. I put the pack over my shoulder.</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;Do not forsake the wisdom there, Terra. At times it will be your
    only salvation. And Oko?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;Yes Mommy?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>She looked to me - a mischievous smile dancing playfully through her
    eyes and across her lips. &quot;Take care of your sister.&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>Then the sensation started. It was a lurching sensation - making me
    sick to my stomach. I found myself in the ceremonial chamber again - the
    complicated lock sitting below me. My instincts not quite reasoning I headed
    for air - my stomach heaving. Water spewed out from my lungs. The water gone
    now I began to vomit - a horrible, inhuman sound expelling the water in my
    stomach. I ran to the bathroom - the convulsions continuing for several
    minutes before I managed to return to my bed - trembling and aching from the
    ordeal.</i></p>
    <p><i>Sitting now on the edge of the bed I turned on my light and looked
    around me. I was awake now - and home. Water mixed with what little was left
    in my stomach lay splattered in the floor - marking my way to the bathroom.
    Everything else was in place however.</i></p>
    <p><i>Everything except Oko.</i></p>
    <p><i>I panicked - nervous - fear sprinkling itself lightly over aching
    muscles. My heart began to beat faster as I did another search of the room.
    My stuffed bear was gone!</i></p>
    <p><i>Upset now at having lost my childhood friend I threw back the covers
    on my bed. The sound of children's laughter filled my ears - taunting me. He
    wasn't there. I started to think where he might be when the woman's final
    word began echoing hollowly&nbsp; through my mind.</i></p>
    <p><i><b>&quot;SISTER!?&quot;</b></i></p>
    <p><i>Just then - something white began squirming its way out from under the
    bed - me staring in disbelief. Working himself free of his impromptu jailing
    the little ursine looked down at the floor - then up at me. A sense of
    concern filled me. Taking another few steps, Oko dragged the leather pack
    out from under the bed with him - both he and the pack still soaking wet
    from our ... adventure. He looked up at me again, locking eyes with me as
    his head tilted quizzically to one side.</i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;You OK, neechan?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>My mind ... wasn't coping with this. My chin dropped - I felt too
    horrible to be dreaming. Was I drugged somehow? I reached down - intending
    to pass my hand through the offending hallucination and reassure myself.
    Instead - I gave the poor thing a resounding slap.</i></p>
    <p><i>Oko started back - looking hurt as he plopped back on his
    hind-quarters. Tears began welling in his eyes. Looking up at me again - his
    eyes begged me to be merciful. </i></p>
    <p><i>&quot;Nee... chan? What's wrong?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>And with that my eyes rolled back in my head - and I fainted.</i></p>
