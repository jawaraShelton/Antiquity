<b>	<p><i>Light ... soft light ... and warmth. It feels nice. I'm bathed in it. I hear a voice - someone talking to me. Someone here? No ... no there's not.
		There's a voice, though - getting clearer.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Hold your breath.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>The voice is soft - caring. It's a woman's voice - strong but warm like the light I'm bathed in. I do as she asks as the light fades - plunging me into
		darkness. It's cold now. It's really cold now. I feel the water pushing back against my limbs ...</i></p>
	<p><b><i>I'm submersed!</i></b></p>
	<p><i><b>PANIC! </b>Panic hits. I need air and I have about 1 minute to find it. I do the obvious and swim upwards - only to hit against the ceiling. <b>Ceiling!?
		</b>I panic again - but calm myself. I'm using my air faster if I panic. I try to stay calm and continue searching for a way up.</i></p>
	<p><i>I see another light - a soft, blue-white glow that appears to come from a point over the water's surface. I swim to it and then upwards - gasping for air.
		My lungs refilled, I tread water.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Where the hell...?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I've noticed the source of the light now - a blue-white ball of energy with sparks hopping across its surface like lightning jumping across clouds. It
		just hovered there - about a foot over the surface of the water. Bobbing gently it hissed and crackled - popping the air with its sparks. I watched it a moment
		- wondering if it would begin to move or not. It didn't. </i></p>
	<p><i>I took a look around.</i></p>
	<p><i>The area I had found was a smallish dome in the center of what seemed to be a large room - although the light from the little ball of lightning wasn't
		strong enough to penetrate that darkness which loomed below. The dome itself was ornately carved with a series of images and magical symbols - none of which I
		understood. Magical symbols were scribed within a magical circle drawn on the dome's perimeter - a circle looking similar to the ones I've seen in movies. The
		symbols - in fact - completely dominated the outer ring of the circle and something just brushed against my leg!</i></p>
	<p><i>I freaked out - screaming as I looked wide-eyed for the offending creature. Only a moment after my scream the small, white head of a stuffed
		polar-bear poked its head up through the surface and wheeled around to stare straight at me.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Hi!&quot; it said enthusiastically - a very human grin somehow - seemingly - dancing its way across his ursine features. &quot;Did you come here
		to see Mommy?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I shook my head in disbelief - paddling cautiously over to the bear. &quot;Mommy?&quot; I asked - looking closer. Kicking hard now to compensate - I
		lifted the now very familiar bear from the water as disbelief washed over my face. </i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Oko!?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Uhm... YEAH!&quot; he replied brightly.</i></p> 
	<p><i>&quot;Oh yeah... This is real. My stuffed bear is talking to me. Right!&quot; I thought before bringing myself back to the present. &quot;Mommy?&quot; 
		I asked.</i></p>
	<p><i>The now amazingly lifelike stuffed animal gave an emphatic nod. &quot;Mommy!&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I looked around me. If not for the utterly surreal experience of talking to my long-time friend of a stuffed bear I would swear it were all very real.
		Hell - I could even smell the place! Even the smell of the ozone was slowly building in the dome from the hissing and crackling of the lightning ball.</i></p>
	<p><i>I looked at the little bear - picturing some gargantuan stuffed toy as its &quot;Mommy&quot;. I caught myself stammering: &quot;Uhm... Yeah. Mommy.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;OK!&quot; The little bear chirped - ducking back under almost immediately. Just as quickly - he popped back up. &quot;Uhm... Terra? Can you
		help me? I'm not allowed to unlock it.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I started - looking at the bear as if the poor thing sprouted a third head (despite having only one now - that is). &quot;Unlock... what?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;The way to go see Mommy!&quot; he said - and slipped back under. The little ball of lightning followed after him - plunking noiselessly into the
		chamber's depths. Shrugging my shoulders I took a deep breath - and went after them.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;You have to unlock this.&quot; I heard Oko's voice as clearly as if we were above water - despite the water. &quot;I'm not allowed.&quot; he
		continued. </i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;OK. How?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>The cub's head tilted sideways - as if in disbelief. &quot;I'm ... uh ... not sure?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>The cub's head shrunk in a bit between his shoulders and his forelegs tensed a bit as his nose wrinkled a bit. &quot;Mommy
    taught me a poem, though.&quot; Oko's ears perked. &quot;You want to hear?&quot;</i></p>
    <p><i>I gave a tentative nod as the cub began his recitation:</i></p>

	<p><i>&quot;Great...&quot; I thought - rolling my eyes. &quot;This is going to be fun.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;YEAH!&quot; Oko replied. &quot;Mommy and Daddy always had fun!&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I snapped my head around to view the mind-reading bear. I figured if looks could kill I'd have blown a hole in the wall. &quot;It's official. This has 
		<b>got</b> to be a dream.&quot; I thought.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;I wish you wouldn't say that. It hurts my feelings!&quot; he retorted. &quot;I don't go around telling you that you don't exist. Meanie.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;GET OUT OF MY HEAD!&quot; was my next thought - a mental scream in objection to his intrusions.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;I can't.&quot; he replied.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;To hell you can't! I'm finishing this dream. How do I unlock this?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;That's easy!&quot; he said brightly. &quot;You might want to take a breath. The keys are in the other rooms.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;The other... rooms?&quot; My heart sank. This was going to be difficult - especially if the dome was my only supply of air.</i></p>
	<p><i>And speaking of air - my lungs are burning.</i></p>
	<p><i>I swam to the dome - exhaling as I approached the surface. Upon breaking through I took a single, deep breath and was again under water. The cub's light
		source was moving to the chamber's center - growing brighter as it did so. By the time it reached its destination the entire chamber was lit.</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;This ... is the lock?&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>&quot;Yup!&quot; replied Oko. &quot;Mommy and Daddy would get the statues and put them in the alcoves inside the little circles drawn on top of the big
		one. Then, the big circle would light up and you would hear this music before the place shaked. Then, they would go
    to the big room hidden upstairs.&quot;</i></p>
	<p><i>I took a careful look at the room - which was some sort of ceremonial chamber. As the cub had described there was a big, ornately carved circle in the
		ground with a hexagonal shape in-scribed into it - a smaller circle at each of the points of the hexagon and strings of symbols used to garnish each 
		individual line. Each of the smaller circles lie in an alcove with small pedestals designed to hold these statues of which Oko spoke.</i></p>
	<p><i>At the center of the room - and the larger circle of which I spoke - was another circle - much more familiar in appearance. Not altogether smallish 
		it was large enough to contain a large man when standing or sitting. The symbols that dominated it were traditional , protective symbols seen in movies 
		like &quot;The Craft&quot; or even TV shows like &quot;Charmed&quot;. I looked up - double-checking where it was. Located directly below the dome in the 
		ceiling (and my air supply) it was the same width around.</i></p>
	<p><i>Of course its purpose - in the end - was completely unknown to me. And speaking of air ... </i></p>
	<p><i>Replenishing the air in my lungs I dove into the water and made immediately for the first statue (not quite understanding how I knew where it was). 
		As I expected - Oko (and his bluish white lightning) followed as if in tow...</i></p>
