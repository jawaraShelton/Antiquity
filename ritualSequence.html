	<p><b><i>As I passed back into the center of the circle the entire chamber
    began lighting - light emanating from each of the 7 circles below me. Music
    filled the waters around me - the sounds from each of the individual statues
    combining into a single opus whose throaty crescendo was accompanied by the
    rumblings of some unknown mechanism below us. Ripples began shooting across
    the surface of the water as the temple walls shook from tremor.</i></p>
    <p><i>And then just as suddenly as the noise began - it stopped.</i></p>
    <p><i>Still slightly disoriented I dove under - looking for the cub. Little
    was to be seen of him but a bluish-white streak as he again screamed his
    battle-cry. &quot;Mommy!&quot; he cried - and launched himself into the corridor. I
    followed him - noticing a new room had opened. The cub paused at the
    entrance - looking unsure. He was waiting for me.</i></b></p>
