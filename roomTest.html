	roomDescriptions[5] = "<b>Wind Elemental Room:</b><br><br><i>In a scene reminiscent of a natural bowl atop a high cliff is perched a great flying beast taking wing. Encompassing a pedestal. in the room's center is a nest created from piled stone - the pedestal itself looking the same.</i><br><br>"

Molten rock flows lazily across the ceiling - its slow, dripping mass sparking long tongues of flame from ceiling to floor as the drops impact. The center of the room contains a stone pedestal - blackened and charred from the exposure - magma oozing lethargically from its cracks.</i><br><br>"

The pedestal - resembling the tip of a small iceburg - sits carefully in the room's center - accessed by a walkway of icy pillars protruding just so from what normally would have been the water's surface - no doubt the very same source of water which flooded this place.</i><br><br>"
	roomDescriptions[6] = "<b>Wood Elemental Room:</b><br><br><i>A series of miniature trees - bonsai - ornament the room - a portion of a single, great tree 	jutting from the ground and arching over the room in a similar manner to its stony cousin in the earth chamber. Thick, gnarled roots creep from the base of the tree - digging brutally into the stone floors like long, bony fingers into freshly dug earth.</i><br><br>"
	roomDescriptions[2] = "<b>Metal Elemental Room:</b><br><br><i>A large, heavy, Victorian clockwork dominates the walls of this room - run off of the steam 	welling up from some source unknown. The pedestal - sat majestically atop a polished, Victorian fixture - contains the clock's face framed in oak and carefully protected by a a glass pane. The hands of the clock are created from well-crafted and delicately etched steel blades.</i><br><br>"
